  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 6. The text \"JHOM=6A\" below \"\u0418\u041d\u0414. \u0422\u041e\u041a\u0410\" confirms that the full scale is 6 Amperes.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major numbered tick marks are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the major tick mark interval is 1 unit (1 A).\n-   **Subdivisions between major marks:** Between any two consecutive major numbered marks (e.g., between 2 and 3), there are 10 smaller tick marks.\n-   **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Since there are 10 subdivisions for every 1 unit, each minor tick mark represents 1 unit / 10 subdivisions = 0.1 units. So, each minor tick represents 0.1 A.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The pointer (needle) is clearly visible.\n-   The pointer is positioned between the major tick mark '2' and the major tick mark '3'.\n-   Counting the minor ticks past the '2' major mark, the pointer aligns precisely with the 6th minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   Start from the lower major tick value: 2 A.\n-   Add the contribution from the minor ticks: The pointer is on the 6th minor tick past 2. Since each minor tick is 0.1 A, this adds 6 * 0.1 A = 0.6 A.\n-   Total reading = 2 A + 0.6 A = 2.6 A.\n-   No interpolation is needed as the pointer is directly on a minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The label \"JHOM=6A\" (Nominal current = 6 Amperes) clearly indicates that the unit for this instrument is Amperes (A). The text \"\u0418\u041d\u0414. \u0422\u041e\u041a\u0410\" translates to \"CURRENT INDICATOR\".\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 2.6 A",
