  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 50.\n- **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are labeled every 10 units (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50).\n- **Subdivisions between major marks:** Between any two major marks (e.g., 0 and 10), there are 10 minor subdivisions.\n- **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Since there are 10 subdivisions between 10 units, each minor tick mark represents 1 unit (10 units / 10 subdivisions = 1 unit/subdivision).\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The pointer is visible and stable.\n- It is positioned between the 20 and 30 major tick marks.\n- Counting from the 20 major tick mark, the pointer is exactly on the 3rd minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- Start from the lower major tick value: 20\n- Add the contribution from minor ticks: 3 minor ticks * 1 unit/minor tick = 3 units\n- Total reading = 20 + 3 = 23\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit displayed on the scale is \"\u03bcA\", which stands for microamperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 23 \u03bcA",
