  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 5.\n- **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are labeled at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, the major tick mark interval is 1 unit.\n- **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Between any two consecutive major tick marks (e.g., 0 and 1, or 1 and 2), there are 10 smaller subdivisions.\n- **Value of each minor tick:** 1 (major interval) / 10 (subdivisions) = 0.1 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The pointer (needle) is clearly visible.\n- It is located between the major tick mark '3' and '4'.\n- Counting from the '3' major tick mark, the pointer aligns exactly with the 4th minor tick.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- Start from the lower major tick value: 3\n- Add the contribution from minor ticks: 4 minor ticks * 0.1 units/minor tick = 0.4 units.\n- Total reading = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The dial has text that includes \"\u042d\u042d\u041c 6\u0410\". The \"\u0410\" indicates Amperes, which is the standard unit for current. The \"\u0418\u041d\u0414 \u0422\u041e\u041a\u0410\" translates to \"Current Indicator\".\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 3.4 A",
