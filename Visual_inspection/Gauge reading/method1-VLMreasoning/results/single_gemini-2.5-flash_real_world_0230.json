  "question": "What is the reading of the north-pointing needle of the compass?",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- Full scale range: 0-360 degrees.\n- MAJOR tick mark intervals: Every 20 degrees (e.g., 0, 20, 40, ..., 340). These are numerically labeled.\n- Minor tick marks: Between major 20-degree marks, there are 9 smaller tick marks, making 10 subdivisions in total.\n- This means there are ticks every 2 degrees (20 degrees / 10 subdivisions = 2 degrees/subdivision).\n- There are also slightly longer minor ticks every 10 degrees (e.g., between 0 and 20, there's a tick for 10).\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The indicator is the red, north-pointing end of the Magnetic Needle.\n- The red tip of the magnetic needle is pointing directly at the \"N\" mark on the rotating bezel.\n- The \"N\" mark corresponds to the 0/360 degree mark on the azimuth ring.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- The needle is aligned precisely with the 0/360 degree mark, which represents North.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit displayed on the scale is degrees (\u00b0).\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 0 degrees",
