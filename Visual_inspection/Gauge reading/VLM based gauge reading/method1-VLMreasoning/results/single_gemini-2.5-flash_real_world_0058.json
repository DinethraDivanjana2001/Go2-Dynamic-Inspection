  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from -1 A to 5 A.\n- **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The numbered major tick marks are at -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The interval between major tick marks is 1 unit.\n- **How many subdivisions are between major marks?** Between any two consecutive major marks (e.g., 0 and 1, or 1 and 2), there are 10 minor subdivisions.\n- **Minor tick mark intervals:** Since there are 10 subdivisions between 1 unit, each minor tick represents 1 unit / 10 subdivisions = 0.1 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The pointer (the thin blue line) is located between the major tick marks 2 and 3.\n- Counting from the major tick mark 2, the pointer aligns with the 7th minor tick mark after 2.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- Start from the lower major tick value: 2 A.\n- Add the contribution from minor ticks: The pointer is on the 7th minor tick past 2. Since each minor tick is 0.1 A, this adds 7 * 0.1 A = 0.7 A.\n- The total reading is 2 A + 0.7 A = 2.7 A.\n- The indicator appears to be exactly on a minor tick, so no interpolation between minor ticks is needed.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The letter \"A\" is clearly displayed in the center of the scale, indicating that the unit is Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 2.7 A",
