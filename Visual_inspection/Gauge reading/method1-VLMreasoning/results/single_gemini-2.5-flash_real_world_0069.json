  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 100.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are numbered at 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. The interval between major marks is 20 units (e.g., 40 - 20 = 20).\n-   **Number of subdivisions between major marks:** Between any two consecutive major marks (e.g., 20 and 40), there are 10 subdivisions (minor tick marks).\n-   **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Since there are 10 subdivisions for every 20 units, each minor tick mark represents 20 units / 10 subdivisions = 2 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The pointer is past the 20 major tick mark.\n-   It is between the 20 and 40 major tick marks.\n-   Counting from the 20 major tick mark, the pointer is aligned exactly with the 9th minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   Start from the lower major tick value: 20\n-   Add the contribution from minor ticks: 9 minor ticks * 2 units/minor tick = 18 units\n-   Total reading = 20 + 18 = 38.\n-   The pointer appears to be precisely on a minor tick, so no interpolation is required.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The unit displayed prominently on the scale is \"mA\", which stands for milliamperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 38 mA",
