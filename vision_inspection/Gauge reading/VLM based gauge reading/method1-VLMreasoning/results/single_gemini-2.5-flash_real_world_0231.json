  "question": "What is the reading of the north-pointing needle of the compass?",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- The compass dial has a full scale range from 0 to 360 degrees.\n- Major tick marks are labeled every 20 degrees (e.g., 20, 40, 60). Cardinal directions like N (North) represent 0/360 degrees.\n- Between the labeled major tick marks (e.g., between 20 and 40), there are longer unlabeled tick marks that represent 10-degree intervals (e.g., 10, 30, 50).\n- Between any two 10-degree marks (e.g., between 0 and 10, or 10 and 20), there are 5 minor tick marks.\n- Therefore, each minor tick mark represents 10 degrees / 5 ticks = 2 degrees.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The indicator is the north-pointing needle, which is the red half of the magnetic needle.\n- This red needle is pointing directly at the 'N' mark on the rotating bezel of the compass.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- The 'N' mark on a compass bezel universally represents North. On a 0-360 degree scale, North is denoted as 0 degrees (or 360 degrees). Since the needle points precisely to 'N', its reading is 0 degrees.\n\n*(Self-correction: While the fixed lubber line (direction of travel arrow) on the baseplate appears to be indicating approximately 356 degrees on the rotating bezel, the question specifically asks for the \"reading of the north-pointing needle.\" The north-pointing needle itself is directly aligned with the 'N' symbol on the bezel.)*\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit displayed on the scale is degrees (\u00b0).\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 0 degrees",
