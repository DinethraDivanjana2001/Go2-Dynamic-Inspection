  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 50.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** Major tick marks are labeled 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The interval between major marks is 10 units (e.g., 10 - 0 = 10).\n-   **Subdivisions between major marks:** Between any two consecutive major marks (e.g., 0 and 10), there are 4 minor tick marks, creating 5 equal segments.\n-   **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Since there are 5 segments for 10 units, each minor tick represents 10 units / 5 segments = 2 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The pointer is located past the '10' major tick mark.\n-   It is exactly aligned with the second minor tick mark after the '10'.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   Starting from the lower major tick value: 10\n-   Add the contribution from minor ticks: The pointer is on the second minor tick. Each minor tick is 2 units. So, 2 minor ticks * 2 units/minor tick = 4 units.\n-   Total reading = 10 + 4 = 14.\n-   The indicator is directly on a minor tick, so no interpolation is needed.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The symbol \"A\" is prominently displayed on the scale, indicating Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 14 A",
