  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- **Full scale range:** The scale spans from 0 to 100.\n- **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** Major tick marks are labeled every 10 units (0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 100).\n- **MINIMUM tick mark intervals:** Between any two major tick marks (e.g., 40 and 50), there are 9 minor ticks, making 10 subdivisions. Therefore, each minor tick mark represents 1 unit (10 units / 10 subdivisions = 1 unit/subdivision).\n- **Subdivisions between major marks:** There are 10 subdivisions between major marks.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The pointer is located between the major tick marks of 40 and 50.\n- Counting from the 40 major tick mark, the pointer aligns precisely with the 5th minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- The pointer is at 5 minor ticks past 40. Since each minor tick represents 1 unit, the reading on the scale is 40 + 5 = 45.\n- The instrument is an ammeter, and according to the label on the top right (next to the terminal where the black wire is connected) and the specifications in the bottom section, the full-scale range selected is 2.5 A.\n- To convert the scale reading to Amperes:\n    Actual Reading = (Pointer Reading / Full Scale Divisions) * Full Scale Range\n    Actual Reading = (45 / 100) * 2.5 A\n    Actual Reading = 0.45 * 2.5 A\n    Actual Reading = 1.125 A\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The instrument is labeled \"\u0410\u041c\u041f\u0415\u0420\u041c\u0415\u0422\u0420\" (Ammeter) and the range is specified in Amperes (A).\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 1.125 A",
