  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- **Full scale range:** The scale ranges from 0 to 2.\n- **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are labeled 0, 1, and 2. The interval between major marks is 1 unit.\n- **Subdivisions between major marks:** Between 0 and 1, there are 10 minor subdivisions. Between 1 and 2, there are also 10 minor subdivisions.\n- **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Since there are 10 subdivisions for every 1 major unit, each minor tick represents 1 / 10 = 0.1 units.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The pointer is visible on the scale.\n- It is located between the major tick mark for 0 and the major tick mark for 1.\n- Counting from 0, the pointer is exactly aligned with the 4th minor tick mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- Starting from 0, the pointer is at the 4th minor tick mark.\n- Each minor tick represents 0.1 units.\n- So, the reading is 0 + (4 * 0.1) = 0.4.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit \"A\" is clearly indicated on the scale, which stands for Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 0.4 A",
