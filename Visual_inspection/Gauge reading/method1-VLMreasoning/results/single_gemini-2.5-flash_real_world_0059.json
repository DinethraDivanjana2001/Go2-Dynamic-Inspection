  "question": "What is the reading of the ammeter",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n-   **Full scale range:** The main scale for positive values goes from 0 to 5. There is also a negative range from -1 to 0. The total visible range is from -1 to 5.\n-   **MAJOR tick mark intervals:** The major tick marks are labeled at -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The interval between these major marks is 1 unit.\n-   **MINOR tick mark intervals:** Between each major tick mark (e.g., between 0 and 1), there are 10 subdivisions. Therefore, each minor tick represents 1 unit / 10 subdivisions = 0.1 units.\n-   **How many subdivisions are between major marks?** 10 subdivisions.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n-   The pointer (needle) is clearly visible.\n-   It is positioned exactly on the major tick mark labeled '-1'.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n-   The red lead is plugged into the \"5A\" terminal, indicating the 5 Ampere range is selected. This means the scale from 0 to 5 directly corresponds to Amperes.\n-   The pointer is precisely at the '-1' mark.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n-   The unit displayed on the scale is 'A', which stands for Amperes.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: -1.0 A",
