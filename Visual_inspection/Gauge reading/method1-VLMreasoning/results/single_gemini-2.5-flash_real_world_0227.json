  "question": "What is the reading of the north-pointing needle of the compass?",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- The full scale range of a compass is 0-360 degrees.\n- The major tick marks are labeled every 20 units (e.g., 0, 20, 40, 60, etc.).\n- Between each major labeled tick mark (e.g., 0 and 20), there is a slightly longer unlabeled tick mark in the middle, representing 10 units.\n- Between a major labeled mark (e.g., 0) and this middle tick (10), there are 4 smaller minor tick marks.\n- This means there are 5 subdivisions between 0 and 10 degrees.\n- Therefore, each minor tick mark represents 10 units / 5 subdivisions = 2 degrees.\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The north-pointing needle is the one with the white tip, pointing generally towards \"N\".\n- The tip of this needle is pointing slightly clockwise from the \"N\" mark (which corresponds to 0 or 360 degrees).\n- Looking closely, the tip of the needle aligns precisely with the second minor tick mark after the \"0\" (North) mark.\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- Start from the \"0\" mark (North).\n- The needle is at the second minor tick past \"0\".\n- Since each minor tick represents 2 degrees, the reading is 0 + (2 * 2 degrees) = 4 degrees.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit is degrees, symbolized by '\u00b0'.\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 4\u00b0",
