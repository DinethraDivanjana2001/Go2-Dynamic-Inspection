  "question": "What is the reading of the north-pointing needle of the compass??",
  "prediction": "**Step 1 - Identify the Scale:**\n- The full scale range of the compass is 0 to 360 degrees.\n- The MAJOR tick mark intervals are every 30 units (e.g., 0, 30, 60, 90, etc.).\n- Between two major 30-degree marks, there are 5 minor tick marks, making 6 subdivisions in total (including the major tick itself).\n- Therefore, the MINOR tick mark interval is 30 degrees / 6 subdivisions = 5 degrees per subdivision.\n- The unit is degrees (\u00b0).\n\n**Step 2 - Locate the Indicator:**\n- The north-pointing needle is the red end of the compass needle.\n- This red needle is pointing directly at the mark labeled '0' (which also represents North).\n\n**Step 3 - Calculate the Reading:**\n- The red, north-pointing needle is precisely aligned with the 0-degree mark.\n\n**Step 4 - Identify the Unit:**\n- The unit displayed on the scale is degrees (\u00b0).\n\n**Step 5 - Provide Final Answer:**\nAnswer: 0 \u00b0",
